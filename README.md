# Overview

This repo contains a keras implementation of the paper: 'SHIP DETECTION IN SAR IMAGES USING CONVOLUTIONAL VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODERS'. 

The presented method uses variational autoencoders and clustering algorithms to label images with and without ships, in an unsupervised manner.

# How to use

Usage (training and testing) should be straightforward, and any needed instructions are given throughout the jupyter notebook that contains the code.

# Dataset

The dataset used to train the network was built based on the dataset developed by [Y. Wang et al.](https://github.com/CAESAR-Radi/SAR-Ship-Dataset).
